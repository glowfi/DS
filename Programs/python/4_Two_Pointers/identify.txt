# When to think of Two Pointers

# 1) Linear data structure
#    - Works on arrays, strings, linked lists (anything you can traverse linearly).

# 2) Sorted array + target condition
#    - Array is sorted (or can be sorted).
#    - Need to find pair/triple with target sum/diff, or maximize/minimize something.
#    - Examples: Two Sum II, 3Sum, Container With Most Water, Sorted Squares.

# 3) Comparing or merging two sequences
#    - Two arrays/strings/lists to merge or compare in order.
#    - Examples: Merge Sorted Arrays, Intersection, Is Subsequence, Merge two lists.

# 4) Partition or rearrange in-place
#    - Move certain elements to one side (zeros, a given value, negatives/positives).
#    - Remove or compress elements without extra space.
#    - Examples: Move Zeroes, Remove Element, Remove Duplicates in Sorted Array.

# 5) Detecting speeds or cycles (fast & slow pointers)
#    - Linked list cycle detection, middle of list, cycle length.
#    - Example: Floyd’s cycle detection, find middle node.

# 6) Subarray or substring with a property (sliding window)
#    - Longest/shortest window satisfying a condition.
#    - Count or check subarrays/substrings with some constraint.
#    - Examples: Longest substring without repeat, min window substring, subarray sum constraints.
