Heap -> narray , binary

Binary Heap -> Complete Binary Tree all nodes filled except last where last level filled from left to right

+ Parent-> Ceil(i/2)-1
+ LC -> 2*i+1
+ RC -> 2*i+2
+ Max nodes at given height h -> 2^h
+ Max nodes in entire Tree -> 2^(h+1) -1
+ Range of leaves -> floor(n/2) to n-1
+ Range of internal nodes (non leaf node with atleast one child) -> 0 to floor(n/2)-1
+ Height -> log2(n)
+ n-> total no of nodes


Identification :

Must have combination of below keywords:
+ must have K
+ smallest/largest

k+smallest -> Max Heap
k+largest  -> Min Heap

+ simplest sol achieved by sorting
+ nlogn -> nlog(k)
