# https://leetcode.com/problems/group-anagrams, Medium, HashMap / Sorting Key

# Question
# Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.


# Example 1:

# Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]

# Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

# Explanation:

# There is no string in strs that can be rearranged to form "bat".
# The strings "nat" and "tan" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# The strings "ate", "eat", and "tea" are anagrams as they can be rearranged to form each other.
# Example 2:

# Input: strs = [""]

# Output: [[""]]

# Example 3:

# Input: strs = ["a"]

# Output: [["a"]]


# Constraints:

# 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
# 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
# strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

# Optimal
# T.C. - O(n*k)
# S.C  -  O(n*k+m)

# Intuition
# Group all the words by their frequency count array
