# Question
# Given a linked list containing n head nodes where every node in the linked list contains two pointers:
# (i) next points to the next node in the list.
# (ii) bottom pointer to a sub-linked list where the current node is the head.
# Each of the sub-linked lists nodes and the head nodes are sorted in ascending order based on their data.
# Your task is to flatten the linked list such that all the nodes appear in a single level while maintaining the sorted order.

# Note:
# 1. â†“ represents the bottom pointer and -> represents the next pointer.
# 2. The flattened list will be printed using the bottom pointer instead of the next pointer.

# Examples:

# Input:

# Output: 5-> 7-> 8-> 10 -> 19-> 20-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 35-> 40-> 45-> 50.
# Explanation:
# Bottom pointer of 5 is pointing to 7.
# Bottom pointer of 7 is pointing to 8.
# Bottom pointer of 8 is pointing to 10 and so on.

# Input:

# Output: 5-> 7-> 8-> 10-> 19-> 22-> 28-> 30-> 50
# Explanation:
# Bottom pointer of 5 is pointing to 7.
# Bottom pointer of 7 is pointing to 8.
# Bottom pointer of 8 is pointing to 10 and so on.

# Constraints:
# 0 <= n <= 100
# 1 <= number of nodes in sub-linked list(mi) <= 50
# 1 <= node->data <= 10^4


# Optimal
# T.C. - O(N)
# S.C  - O(N)
