#### Binary Trees ####

+ Parent Node -> Root node
+ Childe Node -> Childe node
+ Lead Node -> Node with no children
+ Each node can have at max 2 children

#### Types of Binary Trees ####

1. Full Binary Tree: Each node can have 0 or 2 children.

2. Complete Binary Tree: All levels are full execpt the last level.
Last level should be full from left to right.

3. Perfect Binary Tree: All levels are full.Leaf nodes at same level.

4. Balanced Binary Tree: The difference in height of left tree and right tree for any node should 
be less than equal to 1. Left should also be Balanced and right should also be Balanced.

5. Degenerate Tree [Skew Tree]: Entire tree will have only right child or left child.
